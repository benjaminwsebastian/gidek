            <h1>Our plan for the next iteration in couch-surfing</h1>
            <p>We plan on building a platform that works for the whole community. We've talked to a lot of people
                and
                put a lot of thought into the issues with Couchsurfingâ„¢ so we can fix them and build something
                better.</p>

            <p>Primarily we want it to be:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Free for all users forever</li>
                <li>Managed by the community</li>
                <li>Modern and well built, adapting to user needs</li>
                <li>Accessible and safe</li>
            </ol>

            <p>We fundamentally believe that a tool like this can enhance the experiences of its users and
                communities
                that use it if it is executed correctly.</p>

            <p>We want to include the best parts from all the other hospitality exchange platforms out there. This
                includes hosting, surfing, messaging, live hangouts, planned events, trip planning, maps and many
                more.</p>

            <p>If you have ideas for features you'd like to see, please let us know.</p>

            <h2>Our plan</h2>
            <p>These are the key concepts that we will build into the foundation of the platform.</p>
